# Eldwin, the Rogue of Water
Eldwin was a #human #rogue who used his amulet to tap into the medicinal powers of the water. He was also a formidable opponent, and as lethal with his enemies as he was gentle with his allies. His dexterity allowed him to maneuver through enemy lines and provide healing to soldiers while they were still fighting.

As the second Martyr to fall during the [[The Martyr's War]], Eldwin sacrificed himself to enfuse his essence into the river that cuts through [[Taosis]] during the Bloody River, which revitalized the demoralized soldiers but ended his life. The aftermath of his sacrifice replaced him, however. 

Legends state that if you are weary and in need of rest near the Eldwin River, he will look over you and bestow blessings upon you. Many hospitals use his symbol of a swirling river and people worship him in search of healing and recovery.

During the years 1000 S.Y, an assassin quickly gained popularity and reverence within Lindon. There was no record of who this assassin was or what their true identity was, but they quickly gained the title of Eldwin, much to many religious figure’s disdain. Rogues and thieves quickly trusted this figure, and word spread all throughout Taosis. Nothing specific was recorded of them, and it’s uncertain if they are still active to this day.
