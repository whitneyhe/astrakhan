# Dahlia, the Barbarian of Earth
Dahlia was a #human #barbarian who rained from a mountain in the far north. She used her amulet to assist her family in the mines, but was quickly scouted by Lycel when he discovered her adept at molding the earth. As the second youngest by only a few months, Dahlia was rather untrained on the battlefield, but was able to use her amulet to avoid being killed before the others.

Dahlia was the final Martyr to fall during the [[The Martyr's War]], doing so by sacrificing herself in order to create the [[Great Salvation]]. To this day, the creation of the [[Great Salvation]] has been the biggest and most impressive use of an amulet’s power, and has never been matched.

Dahlia is widely recognized as the person who directly ended the Martyr’s War, and is worshipped all throughout [[Taosis]]. She is a general symbol of protection, and people worship her and pray for all sorts of blessings. While there is no “leader” of the Martyrs, she is definitely the most widely worshipped and respected one, despite her age.

Those who believe Lycel to be alive believe that the second coming of Dahlia will be next. Those in [[Loushlan]], specifically [[Tarnstead]], think her second coming will be soon, perhaps within the next hundred years.
