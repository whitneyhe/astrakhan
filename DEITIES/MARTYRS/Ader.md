# Ader, the Figher of Light
Ader was a female fighter who used her amulet to lead the northern troops into the starting battles of [[The Martyr's War]]. 

Due to her reckless fighting style, she was the first Martyr to fall, but not before she led the north to a favorable advantage during the first few decades of the war.
[[The Sun's Guard]] of Taosis all wear the sun symbol in remembrance of her, and those who worship her typically do so in search of strength and leadership as well as physical skill.

Around the year 800 S.Y, a human general from [[Solaris]] of the name [[Rosalina Liel]] rose the ranks extraordinarily quickly, winning the attention of many of the Taosis population. While there hasnâ€™t been any active war time since [[The Martyr's War]], [[Rosalina Liel]] carved an era of peace between the humans and monstrous creatures that still resided within Taosis, and successfully claimed a significant portion of the [[Everdark Forest]] back from the darkness. Many believe that she was a reincarnation of Ader, and she was the first recorded instance of this phenomena.
