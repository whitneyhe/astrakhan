# Ahren, the Monk of Air
Ahren was a monk who used their mastery of the air to their advantage and the youngest Martyr. Prior to obtaining their amulet, they had trained individually and had become an extremely talented martial artist despite their younger age.

They eventually fell only a year after [[Eldwin]] had during their major contribution to the war. Their intelligent placement of revitalized troops and their own personal battalion of monks pushed the [[Ragna]] back, and the Northern Sector had won the territory south of the Eldwin River.

Nowadays, people worship Ahren for guidance. Most monasteries around [[Taosis]] worship them, and focus on reaching their same manipulation of the air in order to move swiftly and unnoticed.

In the year 1032 S.Y, shortly after the assassin known as the “reincarnation” of Eldwin became famous, a human monk gained much popularity as well within the most prestigious monastery within [[Solaris]] known as the [[Monastery of the Swirling Rondo]]. His name was [[Simon Sanks]], and he rose within the ranks at an extraordinary pace. He became the head monk with only a few years of training, and quickly surpassed all of the other head monks of centuries past. Many of the active monks viewed him as a reincarnation of Ahren due to his innate incredible ability. He mysteriously disappeared thirty years after he rose to the role of head monk, and has been presumed dead due to his human lifespan.
