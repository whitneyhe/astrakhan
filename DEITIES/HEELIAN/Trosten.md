# Overview
Trosten is mostly worshipped within [[Zeffari]], and has the most exclusively devoted followers. There arenâ€™t many who worship him in passing, and the majority of his followers are intellectuals who worship him for guidance. He is believed to grant visions of the future to those most devoted to him, and many of the higher ups within Zeffari have received these dreams and spent their lives training on how to interpret them.

There are many different depictions of Trosten, but the most accepted by those in Zeffari view him as a giant whale. He is typically depicted in art as a whale arcing above three differently sized stars, which has become his defining symbol.
