# Ronnoch the Regal
Ronnoch the Regal is a #devil who is [[Sorin]]'s father. He married [[Sorrin's Mother]] thinking she was a tiefling, and when he found out the truth, he left. He also left to pursue becoming a warlock patron, which became extremely profitable for him. He started a Tiefling Cult in [[Myrfal]], which gained him followers and plenty of wealth.

## Tiefling Cult
The Tiefling Cult, currently unnamed, was run by Ronnoch the Regal for around ten years. He gathered followers and had them go out to recruit other tieflings to his cause, promising power and gold. Many of these peaceful tieflings who just wanted to live their calm lives refused, and were killed. This caused an increase of tiefling immigrants to [[Ael'Strom]], and an increase of crime rates in [[Ael'Strom]] due to the oppressive nature of [[Ael'Strom]]'s economy.

[[Eirlani Jaryx]], [[Molly Kingsley]] and [[Rorey Torlen]] are all victims of the cult.
