# HEELE
Heele is an island off of the western coast of the mainland. From the beginning of time, no one has ventured to the island and come back sane enough to retell the contents. As a result, those who are from the mainland know next to nothing about this strange continent.

The island is ruled by druids, and it is rare for people who live on the island to go without druidic abilities. Three major settlements cover the island, with smaller villages and farms scattered throughout. These three settlements separate the island into three segments, each with different deity worship as well as connections to differing aspects of nature. 

## Regions
### Ael’strom
In the north is [[Ael'Strom]], a mountain settlement which primarily worship [[Aeraeth]], their most worshipped god. Bird-folk are known to be present in the mountains and rocky plains surrounding Ael’strom. 

### Myrfal
The central settlement is Myrfal, a woodland-based township. These people have an affinity for healing and plant-based magics. Many earth-roaming races inhabit the areas surrounding Myrfal, as it is the largest segment of the island. Tieflings and some firbolgs are known to exist in this area. They worship hundreds of different deities throughout Myrfal, but their most popular ones are [[Kalina]], [[Barin]], and [[Sopistate]].

### Zeffari
In the south is [[Zeffari]], the “capital” which is the most powerful religious center of Heele. These people are surrounded by water and have an affinity for it. Many higher religious figures also have displayed prophetic abilities, bestowed to them from their most worshipped god, [[Trosten]]. Mermaids and other water-folk are known to roam the surrounding areas of Zeffari.

## Religion
There isn’t a unified religion throughout Heele. There are many deities that many different people worship, so many that there isn’t a compiled list of all of them. The people of Heele don’t typically pick one deity to devote themselves to exclusively, and tend to pick and choose their deities to worship event to event.

A short list of the most popular deities worshipped in Heele is listed below.

### Kalina, the Mistress of Luck
[[Kalina]] is seen as a nature deity and is mostly worshipped within [[Myrfal]]. She is described as a tricky deity, and one who believes in taking chances. Hunters and farmers worship her in order to secure good luck on their hunts and harvests. She doesn’t have a lot of completely devoted followers, and is more popular to be worshipped in passing.

She is usually described or depicted in art as a beautiful woman with her hands spread out over a lush valley, a headdress with two antlers protruding out of it on top of her head. This headdress has evolved to be her defining symbol, and many people mark altars of her with deer antlers.

### Trosten, the Lord of the Sea
[[Trosten]] is mostly worshipped within [[Zeffari]], and has the most exclusively devoted followers. There aren’t many who worship him in passing, and the majority of his followers are intellectuals who worship him for guidance. He is believed to grant visions of the future to those most devoted to him, and many of the higher ups within [[Zeffari]] have received these dreams and spent their lives training on how to interpret them.

There are many different depictions of Trosten, but the most accepted by those in [[Zeffari]] view him as a giant whale. He is typically depicted in art as a whale arcing above three differently sized stars, which has become his defining symbol.

### Aeraeth
[[Aeraeth]] doesn’t have a singular title, as there are many different interpretations of his form and abilities. In a general sense, they preside over the sky, though more specific interpretations of her realm exist, such as clouds, storm, flight as well as general wellbeing while within the air. 

They have no agreed upon form, though they can be typically portrayed as either an eagle, or vague humanoid figure within clouds.
