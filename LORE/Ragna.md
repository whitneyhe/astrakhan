# Ragna
As the only race that reside in Ragnasilda, they have become accustomed to their culture and have frankly forgotten that outside is much different than it is within their valley. The homebrew race on D&D Beyond can be found [here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/subraces/392134-ragna).

## Racial Features
Due to their isolation and unique geographical location, the Ragna have adapted to a difficult way of life, granting them many gifts as well as flaws. Some can speak Common, though the great majority speaks Undercommon due to the way their language has adapted and evolved over the centuries since the War.

### Lifespan
Ragna typically live very long, and do not appear to die from old age, like their elven ancestors. Aging very slowly, Ragna appears physically as a child until they are 20 years old, then slowly age up to appear like a human adult until around the age of 50, when they reach adult maturity. For the rest of their life, they do not age physically beyond the human equivalent of 30 years old, making it extremely difficult to tell the difference between young Ragna and mature Ragna.

### Living in Perpetual Night
Ragna have advantage during stealth checks at night, or in the dark when in their Ragna form.

Ragna have darkened skin which ranges from grey to purple in color, making them deadly night hunters. They have become weak to sunlight, and easily sunburn. They are weak to heat and prefer colder, shady climates.

### Night Vision
Ragna have disadvantage when making perception checks in direct sunlight but have perfect darkvision.

Ragna have developed perfect night-vision due to evolution and lack of daylight hours within Ragnasilda. They can see in the darkness as if it was fully lit by the sun. Direct sunlight, however, makes it difficult for them to see. 

### Eye Color
Ragna have disadvantage when making deception checks when fueled by emotions.

Since the beginning of time, Ragna’s eye colors have shifted depending on which general emotion they were feeling. There is no neutral color, and there has been no research on how these shifts in their eyes happen. 

**The colors are as follows:**
- Joy: Yellow
- Anger: Red
- Sadness: Blue

This ability had historically been useful for communication between families in the earlier years of the Ragna civilization, and there was little care for which any Ranga possessed at any time. In modern times, however, having vibrant red eyes is seen as honorable, and those who have vibrant blue are seen as weaker than their peers, enough so that a derogatory term was coined: *saldyr*, which is a slang term for weakling in the Ragna language. 

### Uncanny Disguise
Ragna have access to an adjusted ***Disguise Self*** spell which has no duration and can only change their coloring.

Ragna have the ability to change the coloring of their appearance. This was originally used to avoid discrimination prior to [[The Martyr's War]], but has still remained an intigral part of Ragna abilities. This ability, however, has never been able to mask the changing of Ragna’s eye colors with the shifting of their emotions. 

## Culture
Ragna usually live in families, isolated from other groups of people. Families are large with many siblings. Towns are uncommon due to this, the only major “city” being Kaylnr, or the “City of Love”. This is where many newly-matured Ragna go to find partners. Ragna are extremely independent, and typically don’t work in groups unless necessary. They are also extremely loyal to their families, typically staying as long as necessary with their immediate family until it is time to move on. Due to their long lifespans, Ragna don’t typically marry or have children until they are a few thousand years old. 

Each family is either ruled by a matriarch, patriarch, or jointly ruled by two equal members of the family. The head of the family is the one that unites the family, and can have as many partners as they wish. Think of Ragna marriage culture as a lot of healthy poliamorous relationships. Monogamy is not unheard of, and is quite common. 

Culturally, both male and female Ragna do not cut their hair until their head of the family deems them mature enough to be considered an adult. They shave their head, and then keep their hair shortly cropped for the rest of their life. This originally came about due to the difficulty they had discerning teenage Ragna and adult Ragna, but has evolved into a way of identifying who is mature enough to be trusted. It holds such social weight that if a patriarch does not approve the cutting of the Ragna’s hair they will be unable to do anything by themselves, as they will still be seen as a child.
