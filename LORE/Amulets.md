# Amulets
Amulets were first discovered in the [[Holbeck Mountains]] prior to [[The Martyr's War]]. They were originally stones that had a unique magical connection to the five natural elements of the world: air, earth, water, darkness and light. In modern times, these amulets are used as arcane focuses, and allow the user to wield a much wider range of magic.

## Prior to Martyr’s War
Amulets were used as a simple helping hand in Taosis. The magic within them was primal and primitive, and very very expensive. They were used by the upper class as a demonstration of wealth, or by the lucky few of the lower class to greatly help them with businesses, getting them ahead of their peers. 

Shippers on the sea used their amulets to help expedite their shipments and lumber-workers and farmers in the wooden country of [[Mylanda]] used them to enrich their soils and easily chop down their trees.

Eventually, [[Ragna]] caught wind of these amulets and how King Juliun was holding them from their race. After countless attempts to solve the problem non-violently, the [[Ragna]] declared war, and [[The Martyr's War]] began.

## After the Martyr’s War
After [[The Martyr's War]] and people had seen the pure power that could be wielded with enough patience and training, many schools of magic popped up around Taosis, the most predominant one being the [[The Solaris Academy of the Arcane]] held in the castle where the Queen held her throne.

In the centuries after the war, the magic within the amulets was quickly maximized. Amulets became much cheaper, but still a greatly taxing investment.
