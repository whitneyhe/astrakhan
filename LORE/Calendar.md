# Calendar Systems
Due to the disunity between [[Heele]], [[Taosis]] and [[Ragnasilda]], each group has different a calendar. For the purposes of the campaign, the party will be using the [[Taosis]] calendar.

## Taosis Calendar
The Taosis calendar began counting years since the [[Great Salvation]] ended the [[The Martyr's War]]. The current year is **1343**.

Instead of months, the Taosis calendar is split into four seasons each with ninty days. The seaons are split into nine weeks, each with ten days. These days do not have names, since they are easily identifiable due to the date.

### Seasons & Holidays
**Frilace** is the Taosis word for "winter", and is the season that starts the year. 
- The [[Mylandian Tournament]] starts on the 1st and ends on the 20th of Frilace. The winner usually leaves on the 30th of Frilace.

**Lurlace** is the Taosis word for "spring", and is the second season of the year.

**Solace** is the Taosis word for "summer", and is the third season of the year.

**Curlace** is the Taosis word for "fall", and is the season that finishes off the year.

## Heele Calendar
The Heele calendar is focused primarily on rotation of the stars, and is currently in the year 5093. The years started being counted by Zeffari intellectuals when they moved to Heele and began settlements there. There are twelve months all split into thirty days. Each month is named after the constellation present in the sky at the time. Weeks are ten days long.

**Balaena** is the first month of the Heele calendar, named after the whale. It begins partway through Solace in the Taosis calendar. The constellation is a Whale, and is the sacred month of [[Trosten]].

**Bos** is the second month of the Heele calendar, named after the cow. It takes place in the final thirty days of Solace in the Taosis calendar. The constellation is a cow, and is the sacred month of [[Barin]].

**Cervus** is the third month of the Heele calendar, named after the stag. It takes place in the first thirty days of Curlace in the Taosis calendar. The constellation is a stag, and is the sacred month of [[Kalina]].

**Columba** is the fourth month of the Heele calendar, named after the dove. It takes place in the middle thirty days of Curlace in the Taosis calendar. The constellation is a dove, and is the sacred month of [[Sopistate]].
