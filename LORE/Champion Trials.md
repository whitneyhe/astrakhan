# The Champion Trials
The Champion Trials are a set of Trials that takes place on [[Heele]] and is the only known way to legally exit Heele. The three Trials each takes place in one of the major cities on Heele, [[Ael'Strom]], [[Myrfal]], and [[Zeffari]].

The Trials must be completed in the order mentioned above. A certificate is given out to those who take the Trials in order to prove they have completed one city's Trial and are eligable to take on the nexts. 

Speaking about the contents of the Trials is forbidden, and magically enforced, though no one really knows who initially set these magical rules into place. It is general knowledge that the first two Trials are more or less harmless, while the final one is typically the most deadly, with no one coming out of it alive.

For each Trial, you have three ways of getting out of it. Dying, Succeeding, or Forfeiting. Forfeiting prevents the person from taking that Trial again, and essentially traps them on Heele for the rest of their lives.

## Ael'Strom Trial
The [[Ael'Strom]] Trial is a set of puzzles at the top of the mountain that makes up [[Ael'Strom]]. Each puzzle takes place in a room filled with magical darkness that only lifts after everyone taking part in the Trials steps through the door to the other side. 

The first puzzle takes place in a pool of harmless liquid enchanted to look like lava, acid, and electrified water depending on the angle the perceiver is looking at it. There are two gears on either side of the entrance door, which can only turn one way. Turning these levers raises the levels of the liquid until they raise higher than the hidden hole, which drains the room of all of the liquid, revealing a door beneath a ladder.

The second puzzle is a long room 

## Myrfal Trial
The [[Myrfal]] Trial is a 10-day (week long) Trial that takes place in the Fogged Woods, a location in [[Myrfal]]. The party is stripped of their armor, and many supplies other than one of their weapons, or a few spells from their spellbook. 

The party has a pack of wolves that were given their scent, an inscentive to keep moving throughout the Woods.

The Trial's purpose is to see if the party can survive for that long without any supplies. After the 10 days are up, the party finds that they wake up back in [[Myrfal]], with all of their belongings.
