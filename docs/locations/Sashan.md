# Sashan
Sashan holds the capital of [[Taosis]], [[Solaris]]. It is well known as the richest area of Taosis and those who grow up outside of this kingdom view it as snobby and superficial. But, there is no denying the prestige that comes from their various institutes such as [[The Solaris Academy of the Arcane]] and [[The Monastery of the Swirling Rondo]].

## Solaris
[[Solaris]] is the capital of Taosis, and holds the palace where the Queen lives. It is a city built on a small plateau within the [[Holbeck Mountains]]. [[Solaris]] is easily the largest city within Taosis, rivaled only by [[Ship’s Haven]] in [[Loushan]], though the cities could not be more different. Where [[Ship’s Haven]] is diverse, [[Solaris]] houses only the highest ranking intellectuals, monks and other occupations. The price of living in [[Solaris]] is extremely expensive but justified due to the highest standard of living which is upheld there. [[Solaris]] holds [[The Solaris Academy of the Arcane]], the most prestigious arcane academy in Taosis.

Those who are from [[Solaris]] are rich and considered snobby, though are well educated and usually highly trained in their area of expertise.
