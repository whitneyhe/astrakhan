# Ael'Strom
Ael'Strom is the northernmost settlement in Heele, and is inside and around the largest mountian on the island. The structure of Ael'Strom is circular, and carved into the mountain. There is a large central spire in the center which houses the [Ael'Strom Council](/docs/organizations/aelstromCouncil.md), which is a group of elected officials who run different sections of the city.

The buildings within Ael'Strom appear rickety and unstable, but are enchanted to stay completely solid.
