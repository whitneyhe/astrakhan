Zeffari is full of intellectual and religous life. It has a wide variety of dense historical texts in its library, though no real room for light reading. *[A DC15 intelligence check is needed to even understand what's going on inside]*

The members of the [[Heele Institute for Education]] is located in Zeffari.
