# Lindon
Lindon is the northernmost kingdom in [[Taosis]]. The kingdom is made mostly of mountains and forests, and has few cities. The Lidonese people do have [[Amulets]], though mostly in the capital of [[Archmouth]]. The population of magic users dwindles the further you get from the capital. 

Lindonese people are very separated from the conflict with the [[Ragna]]. Most people in Lindon care very little about the [[Ragna]], and their ancestors were likely not very involved in the [[The Martyr's War]]. Their connection to [[Dahlia]], however, is the strongest due to her origins in Tarnstead.

## Archmouth
The capital of Lindon is [[Archmouth]]. [[Archmouth]] is a major mining city due to its proximity to the mountains. They ship their minerals down the neighboring river. [[Archmouth]] is also very fond of [[Dahlia]], though not as devoted as [[Tarnstead]] is. There are no monasteries within [[Archmouth]].

## Tarnstead
[[Tarnstead]] is a mountain town that has a main economy of shipping precious gems and stones across Taosis through [[Archmouth]]. 

Since [[The Martyr's War]], [[Tarnstead]] has evolved into a town devoted to [[Dahlia]]. The largest [[Dahlia]] temple resides on top of a mountain near where she originally lived. While [[Dahlia]] is typically only worshipped generally and doesn’t have a ton of devoted followers, the majority of [[Tarnstead]] is fully devoted to her and doesn’t pay much attention to the other Martyrs. The population wholeheartedly believes that she was the most powerful Martyr. Over the centuries, they have been the most attentive towards looking for a [[Dahlia]] reincarnation, as they are all convinced she will be reborn in her hometown.

Those from [[Tarnstead]] typically favor [[Dahlia]] over any other Martyr, though are usually hard workers and relatively laidback compared to the rest of Taosis.
